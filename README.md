# Online-retail-Application-store-database
Online retail Application store database (ORAS DataBase)

This project was developed as part of the IT131 course to bridge the gap between database theory and real-world application. We designed and implemented a comprehensive database system for an Online Retail Store (inspired by platforms like Amazon and Noon).

The core of our work focused on building a robust structural foundation starting from Requirement Analysis to a fully functional Relational Schema.

 What we implemented:
ER Diagram (ERD) Design: We mapped out the entire system's logic, identifying key entities like Customers, Products, Orders, Shipping, and Payments.

Database Normalization: To ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy, we applied normalization techniques up to 4NF.

Relational Schema & Integrity: Defined relationships using Primary Keys and Foreign Keys to maintain referential integrity.

SQL Implementation: * DDL: Created the structured tables.

DML: Populated the system with realistic data.

Advanced Querying: Developed complex queries using JOINs and Nested Subqueries to simulate real business reports.
